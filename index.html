            <p>Hey there! My name is Jiro Kakpovbia, and I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, graduating in Spring 2027. From a young age, my fascination with computing and programming has been a driving force in my academic and personal pursuits. At age 13, I independently developed a platformer video game in Python, which laid the foundation for my deep technical skills and passion for software development. Since then, through coursework and employment, I have honed my skills in various programming languages. Additionally, as a former student-athlete, I've learned to stay organized and motivate myself to succeed in both academically and athletically.
Feel free to reach out -- always open to meeting new people!
