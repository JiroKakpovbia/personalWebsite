                        Hi! My name is Jiro Kakpovbia, and I'm a {currentAcademicYear}.
                        At age 13, I independently developed a platformer video game in Python, which laid the foundation for my deep technical skills and passion for software development.
                        Since then, through my coursework and employment, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and development tools.
                        Outside of programming, I enjoy watching football, working out, and making music.
                    </p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Please feel free to reach out â€” I'm always open to meeting new people!</p>
                    <br></br>
